# The "Guess a number" Game.
# Project goals 
Guess the Number is a simple game where the computer generates a number in the range from 0 to 100 (level one). The user's role is to guess the number generated by the computer in a certain number of trials. If he guesses it, he gets congratulations and goes to the next level, where the range of the randomly generated number by the computer increases. If he doesn't recognize it, he has the option to continue playing again and succeed.
The game ends either when the user has reached the maximum number of levels or when they indicate that they do not want to try again. 

# Solution
The project mainly uses loops, specifically the while loop, various algorithms, technologies and libraries. Mostly different if-else checks for game results. Also a random number generation library.
